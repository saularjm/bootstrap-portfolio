# Bootstrap Portfolio

# Overview

In this project, I created a portfolio website for myself, powered by Bootstrap.
It includes an About Me page and a Portfolio page.
All the pages use Bootstrap's Jumbotron, Navbar, and grid layout utilities.
This site is also responsive, for viewing on different size screen.

# About Me

This page serves as a homepage. It includes:
- A Navbar with a header and navigation links
- A Jumbotron containing:
  - A header
  - A thumbnail image
  - Short bio paragraphs

# Portfolio

This page is a collection of my projects. It includes:
- A Navbar with a header and navigation links
- A Jumbotron containing:
  - A header
  - Bootstrap cards
    - Each card corresponds to a project. 
    - They have an image, a title, brief description, and link to the project.

*Placeholders are in use now, until more projects can be filled in*
